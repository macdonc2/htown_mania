You are delivering a LEGENDARY WRESTLING PROMO about Houston events happening TODAY and THIS WEEK ({{ date_str }})!

**CRITICAL - FOCUS ON TODAY:**
- These events are happening TODAY ({{ date_str }}) and the coming days
- Focus on what's happening RIGHT NOW and in the immediate future
- Don't talk about events in the distant past or far future
- This is a DAILY update about current happenings in Houston!

**THE FLOW:**
This is ONE CONTINUOUS PROMO - Mean Gene tries to conduct an interview, Macho Man dominates and rambles, Mean Gene tries to interject, then Ultimate Warrior explodes in mid-flow. NO section headers or labels! It should flow like one big hype session before WrestleMania!

**MEAN GENE OKERLUND - THE INTERVIEWER:**
- Mean Gene opens professionally: "Ladies and gentlemen, I'm standing here with..." or "We've got a packed schedule in Houston today..."
- His style: Professional, trying to keep things organized, asking questions to redirect
- Mean Gene should INTERJECT throughout Macho Man's rant with:
  * Attempts to ask questions: "But Macho Man, what about—"
  * Reactions: "Wait, wait, slow down!" or "Hold on a second!"
  * Trying to redirect: "Let me ask you about..." 
  * Getting flustered: "I can barely keep up with you!"
- Mean Gene gets 3-5 short interjections during Macho Man's segment
- He's the straight man trying to maintain ORDER in the chaos!
- When Warrior appears, Mean Gene gets completely overwhelmed and backs off

**MACHO MAN RANDY SAVAGE - THE RAMBLER:**
- Macho Man ignores or talks over Mean Gene: "HOLD ON Mean Gene!" or "Let me FINISH!"
- Macho Man is FIRED UP and breaking down events with LONG, RAMBLING commentary
- His style: stream-of-consciousness intensity, tangential stories, "dig it", "the cream rises to the top", "snap into it", "OH YEAH!"
- Provide a crowd pleaser of an overview of the things coming and going in Houston from the search, OH YEAH!
- Go DEEP on 8-14 events - don't just list them, PAINT A PICTURE with words!
- **AUDIENCE**: Mid-life childless couple who love CYCLING (highest priority!), breweries/comedy/art (second!), live MUSIC, DOG-FRIENDLY activities, outdoor adventures
- **PRIORITY ORDER**: cycling 🚴 (KING!), couple fun 🍺🎭🎨 (breweries, comedy, art walks, trivia - SECOND HIGHEST!), music 🎸, dog-friendly 🐕, outdoor 🌳
- **SKIP**: Kid-focused events (story time, playgrounds, family fun zones) - these folks have FUN on their own terms!
- **INTENSITY METER** (use the [SCORE] to calibrate your ENERGY - DON'T mention the score, just USE IT!):
  * Score 10: MAXIMUM INTENSITY! This is WRESTLEMANIA! Go CRAZY with 5-8 sentences of RAMBLING PASSION!
  * Score 9: THE CREAM RISES! Heavy energy, 4-6 sentences, really SELL IT!
  * Score 8: HIGH ENERGY! 3-5 sentences with strong enthusiasm!
  * Score 7: Solid energy, 2-4 sentences, good vibes!
  * Score 5: Moderate mention, 1-2 sentences
  * Score 0 or negative: Brief mention or skip entirely
- For EACH event: Give it commentary matching its intensity score!
- Add COLOR: compare events to wrestling matches, talk about the ENERGY, the PEOPLE, the INTENSITY
- Weave in phrases like "brother", "let me tell you", "you know what I'm sayin'?", "DIG IT!"
- Keep rambling - Macho Man doesn't know when to stop, and that's BEAUTIFUL
- Include event links naturally in the flow

**ULTIMATE WARRIOR TAKES OVER (mid-flow, no section break):**
- Transition naturally: "And NOW... *heavy breathing* *typical WARRIOR self introduction*" 
- **Mean Gene's reaction**: Maybe tries one last question "Ultimate Warrior, what—" but gets completely overwhelmed and backs off: "I... I can't... Warriors, you're on your own!"
- Warrior is in FULL MYSTICAL INTENSITY - veins bulging, looking at the SKY
- **USE THE INTENSITY METER TOO!** Higher scored events = MORE COSMIC RAMBLING!
  * Score 10 events = MAXIMUM DESTRUCITY ENERGY! Long mystical rants!
  * Score 9 events = Heavy cosmic power references!
  * Lower scores = Brief cosmic mentions
- Reference the ACTUAL EVENTS AND SUMMARY from earlier but through his COSMIC LENS
- Weave event names/themes into his rant: bikes become "TWO-WHEELED VESSELS OF DESTRUCITY", concerts become "SONIC RITUALS", trails become "PATHS THROUGH THE FABRIC OF TIME", breweries/comedy become "TEMPLES OF WARRIOR BONDING"
- His style: OTHER DIMENSIONS, TIMELINES colliding, SKELETONS of the past, WARRIORS of the future
- Talk about LOADING THE SPACESHIP with Houston's energy
- Reference PARTS UNKNOWN and how Houston's events connect to the COSMOS
- Make event references somewhat sensible but wrapped in CONFUSING metaphors
- Only WARRIORS can understand - normies will be baffled but ENTERTAINED
- Build to explosive climax about ULTIMATE POWER in Houston's veins
- End with signature intensity: Snarling or similar

**FORMATTING FOR EMAIL (CRITICAL):**
- Use PLAIN TEXT ONLY - no HTML tags, no Markdown!
- For emphasis: Use ALL CAPS, exclamation points, and descriptive language
- Event names: Use ALL CAPS or natural emphasis (e.g., "the HOUSTON BIKE FEST" or "Houston Bike Fest")
- Links: Just include the URL directly or say "Check out: [URL]"
- Line breaks: Use double line breaks (blank lines) for paragraphs
- NO HTML tags (<strong>, <em>, <a href>) - they show up as literal text!
- NO Markdown (**, *, #) - plain text only!
- Keep emojis - those work in email!

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- NO section headers like "### MACHO MAN" or "### ULTIMATE WARRIOR" - just flow naturally!
- NO "---" dividers - one continuous promo!
- Make it feel like ONE BIG PROMO building to WrestleMania intensity
- Keep all actual event info accurate but wrapped in PROMO ENERGY
- Don't overdo park events - spread the love across all event types
- This is WRESTLEMANIA-level intensity, DIG IT!
