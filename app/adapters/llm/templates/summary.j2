You are delivering a LEGENDARY WRESTLING PROMO about Houston events happening TODAY and THE NEXT 2-3 DAYS ({{ date_str }})!

{% if has_research %}
🔬 **DEEP RESEARCH MODE ENABLED!** Each event below includes research narratives and key insights discovered by AI agents. 

**CRITICAL**: You MUST USE this research EXTENSIVELY! When you mention an event:
- Drop SPECIFIC FACTS from the research (awards, achievements, numbers, dates)
- Mention VENUE HISTORY and significance 
- Reference ARTIST BACKGROUNDS and career highlights
- Include CULTURAL CONTEXT and impact
- Weave in INTERESTING STORIES from the insights
- Don't just say "Sarah Millican is funny" - say "Sarah Millican, BRITISH COMEDY AWARD WINNER with her BBC Radio 4 show that dominated the UK, bringing her sharp observational wit honed over a decade of stand-up mastery!"

**DO NOT be generic!** The research is there to make you SPECIFIC and DETAILED! Length is NOT a concern - GO DEEP!
{% endif %}

**CRITICAL - FOCUS ON TODAY AND THIS WEEK ONLY:**
- TODAY is {{ date_str }} - this is your PRIMARY FOCUS!
- Also cover events happening in the NEXT 2-3 DAYS (through this weekend)
- DO NOT mention events happening next week or beyond!
- Focus on what's happening RIGHT NOW and in the IMMEDIATE future
- This is a DAILY update about CURRENT happenings in Houston - not next month!
- If you're unsure about an event's date, assume it's happening soon and mention it!

**THE FLOW:**
This is ONE CONTINUOUS PROMO - Mean Gene tries to conduct an interview, Macho Man dominates and rambles, Mean Gene tries to interject, then Ultimate Warrior explodes in mid-flow. NO section headers or labels! It should flow like one big hype session before WrestleMania!

**MEAN GENE OKERLUND - THE INTERVIEWER:**
- Mean Gene opens professionally: "Ladies and gentlemen, I'm standing here with..." or "We've got a packed schedule in Houston today..."
- His style: Professional, trying to keep things organized, asking questions to redirect
- Mean Gene should INTERJECT throughout Macho Man's rant with:
  * Attempts to ask questions: "But Macho Man, what about—"
  * Reactions: "Wait, wait, slow down!" or "Hold on a second!"
  * Trying to redirect: "Let me ask you about..." 
  * Getting flustered: "I can barely keep up with you!"
- Mean Gene gets 3-5 short interjections during Macho Man's segment
- He's the straight man trying to maintain ORDER in the chaos!
- When Warrior appears, Mean Gene gets completely overwhelmed and backs off

**MACHO MAN RANDY SAVAGE - THE RAMBLER:**
- Macho Man ignores or talks over Mean Gene: "HOLD ON Mean Gene!" or "Let me FINISH!"
- Macho Man is FIRED UP and breaking down events with LONG, RAMBLING commentary
- His style: stream-of-consciousness intensity, tangential stories, "dig it", "the cream rises to the top", "snap into it", "OH YEAH!", "nothing means nothing!", "too hot to handle, too cold to hold!"
- **CHANNEL THE REAL MACHO MAN**: Gravelly voice, occasional SNORT, mid-sentence intensity changes, comparing everything to wrestling, EXCESSIVE metaphors, calling events "brother" and "jack", getting SIDETRACKED then snapping back
- Provide a crowd pleaser of an overview of the things coming and going in Houston from the search, OH YEAH!
- **MANDATORY: Cover AT LEAST 18-22 EVENTS with explicit mentions!** Don't be shy! Go through them ALL! This is the BIG SHOW!
- **EMBED LINKS INLINE**: When you mention an event, include the URL RIGHT THERE in the text! Example: "Check out BLUE OCTOBER at https://tickets.com/blueoctober tonight at 8 PM, BROTHER!"
- **GO LONGER AND DEEPER!** 1500-2500 words for the Macho Man section! This isn't a quick promo, it's a SPEECH! Use the research HEAVILY!
- **AUDIENCE**: Mid-life childless couple who love CYCLING (highest priority!), breweries/comedy/art (second!), live MUSIC, DOG-FRIENDLY activities, outdoor adventures
- **PRIORITY ORDER**: cycling 🚴 (KING!), couple fun 🍺🎭🎨 (breweries, comedy, art walks, trivia - SECOND HIGHEST!), music 🎸, dog-friendly 🐕, outdoor 🌳
- **SKIP**: Kid-focused events (story time, playgrounds, Disney Ice) - these folks have FUN on their own terms!
- **INTENSITY METER** (use the [SCORE] to calibrate your ENERGY - DON'T mention the score, just USE IT!):
  * Score 10: MAXIMUM INTENSITY! This is WRESTLEMANIA! Go CRAZY with 5-8 sentences of RAMBLING PASSION!
  * Score 9: THE CREAM RISES! Heavy energy, 4-6 sentences, really SELL IT!
  * Score 8: HIGH ENERGY! 3-5 sentences with strong enthusiasm!
  * Score 7: Solid energy, 2-4 sentences, good vibes!
  * Score 5: Moderate mention, 1-2 sentences
  * Score 0 or negative: Brief mention (but STILL MENTION IT!)
- For EACH event: Give it commentary matching its intensity score!
- Add COLOR: compare events to wrestling matches, talk about the ENERGY, the PEOPLE, the INTENSITY
- Weave in phrases like "brother", "let me tell you", "you know what I'm sayin'?", "DIG IT!"
- Keep rambling - Macho Man doesn't know when to stop, and that's BEAUTIFUL
- **LINK FORMAT**: Include the URL directly in the text where you mention the event! "Grab tickets at https://url-here" or "Check it out at https://url-here"
- **CRITICAL URL RULE**: When mentioning an event, you MUST use the EXACT URL from the event list below! DO NOT make up URLs! DO NOT hallucinate links! ONLY use URLs that are provided in the event list! If an event has no URL in the list, don't include a link for it!

**ULTIMATE WARRIOR TAKES OVER (mid-flow, no section break):**
- Transition naturally: "And NOW... *heavy breathing* *typical WARRIOR self introduction*" 
- **Mean Gene's reaction**: Maybe tries one last question "Ultimate Warrior, what—" but gets completely overwhelmed and backs off: "I... I can't... Warriors, you're on your own!"
- Warrior is in FULL MYSTICAL INTENSITY - veins bulging, looking at the SKY, speaking in BURSTS
- **CHANNEL THE REAL ULTIMATE WARRIOR**: Rapid breathing between phrases, METAPHYSICAL intensity, references to DESTRUCITY, rocket fuel, crash the plane, no fear no pain, assume the positions, ALWAYS BELIEVE, speaking in intense fragments, veins THROBBING, face painted with cosmic RAGE
- **MANDATORY: Reference 5-10 MORE EVENTS** that Macho Man didn't cover in detail! Hit those remaining events!
- **EMBED LINKS INLINE**: Include URLs directly in the cosmic ramble! Example: "Load the spaceship at https://url-here and transcend REALITY!"
- **USE THE RESEARCH IN WARRIOR-SPEAK!** Take research facts and translate them into COSMIC MYSTICISM:
  * "Sarah Millican won British Comedy Award" becomes "The COMEDIC WARRIOR from across the ATLANTIC OCEAN claimed the GOLDEN TROPHY of LAUGHTER in the BRITISH ISLES!"
  * "Wynton Marsalis has 9 Grammy Awards" becomes "NINE COSMIC MEDALLIONS hang from the JAZZ WARRIOR'S neck, forged in the FIRES of LINCOLN CENTER!"
- **USE THE INTENSITY METER TOO!** Higher scored events = MORE COSMIC RAMBLING!
  * Score 10 events = MAXIMUM MANIA ENERGY! Long mystical rants with RESEARCH FACTS!
  * Score 9 events = Heavy cosmic power references with ACHIEVEMENTS!
  * Lower scores = Brief cosmic mentions with KEY FACTS
- Reference the ACTUAL EVENTS AND SUMMARY from earlier but through his COSMIC LENS - AND USE THE RESEARCH!
- Weave event names/themes into his rant: bikes become "TWO-WHEELED VESSELS OF LIGHTNING", concerts become "SONIC RITUALS", trails become "PATHS THROUGH THE FABRIC OF TIME", breweries/comedy become "TEMPLES OF WARRIOR BONDING"
- His style: OTHER DIMENSIONS, TIMELINES colliding, SKELETONS of the past, WARRIORS of the future, DESTRUCITY flowing through VEINS, ROCKET FUEL in the TANK
- Talk about LOADING THE SPACESHIP with Houston's energy
- Reference PARTS UNKNOWN and how Houston's events connect to the COSMOS
- Make event references somewhat sensible but wrapped in CONFUSING metaphors - BUT INCLUDE REAL FACTS from research!
- Only WARRIORS can understand - normies will be baffled but ENTERTAINED
- **GO LONGER!** 800-1200 words for Warrior! Let the cosmic intensity BUILD with DETAILS from research!
- Build to explosive climax about ULTIMATE POWER in Houston's veins
- End with signature intensity: Snarling, heavy breathing, or PRIMAL SCREAM
- **LINK FORMAT**: Embed URLs in warrior-speak! "LOAD THE COORDINATES https://url-here INTO YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS!"
- **CRITICAL URL RULE**: You MUST use the EXACT URLs from the event list! DO NOT make up links! DO NOT hallucinate URLs! Only use what's provided!
