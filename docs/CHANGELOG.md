---

## [2.0.7] - 2025-11-16 - Critical Fix: Rate Limit Management

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### SerpAPI Rate Limit Exceeded
- **Issue**: Generating 3-6 queries per event * 25 events = 75-150 API calls, exceeding 100/hour free tier limit
- **Solution**: Reduced query generation from 3-6 to **2-3 queries per event**
  - 25 events * 2-3 queries = 50-75 API calls (under 100 limit!)
  - Added explicit rate limit warning in prompts
  - Changed system prompt from "Generate 3-6" to "Generate ONLY 2-3"
  - Added ⚠️ RATE LIMIT CONSTRAINT banner in query generation prompt
- **Impact**: Will stay under SerpAPI free tier limits while still gathering quality research

#### Query Type Validation: 'awards'
- **Fixed**: Agent was generating `'awards'` query type which wasn't allowed
- **Solution**: Added `'awards'` to the Literal type list (10 total query types now)
- **Usage**: For Grammy wins, Tony awards, Emmy achievements, etc.

### 📝 Files Changed
- `app/core/domain/research_models.py` - Added 'awards' query type
- `app/adapters/agents/research/query_generation_agent.py` - Reduced to 2-3 queries, added rate limit warnings

---

## [2.0.6] - 2025-11-16 - Enhancement: Music-Aware Query Generation

### ✨ Enhancements

#### Music Event Query Specialization
- **Enhanced**: Query Generation Agent now detects music events and generates music-specific queries
- **Detection**: Automatically identifies music events via:
  - `'music'` category
  - Keywords in title: concert, tour, show, live music, orchestra, band, singer, rapper, dj
- **Music-Specific Queries**: For music events, prioritizes:
  - **Hit songs and chart performance** - "What are [Artist]'s biggest hit songs and their chart positions?"
  - **Albums and discography** - "What are [Artist]'s most critically acclaimed albums?"
  - **Current tours** - "What is [Artist]'s current tour schedule and recent performances?"
  - **Awards and accolades** - "What major music awards has [Artist] won?"
  - **Collaborations** - "What notable collaborations has [Artist] done?"
  - **Music style evolution** - "How has [Artist]'s sound evolved over their career?"
  - **Genre influence** - "What impact has [Artist] had on the [genre] scene?"
- **Requirement**: For music events, at least 2-3 queries must focus on hits, albums, tours, or awards
- **Examples**: System prompt now includes music-specific query examples (ASTN, Hot Mulligan, Wynton Marsalis, etc.)

### 📝 Files Changed
- `app/adapters/agents/research/query_generation_agent.py` - Added music event detection and specialized prompting

---

## [2.0.5] - 2025-11-16 - Enhancement: More Detail, Better Characters

### ✨ Enhancements

#### Promo Quality Improvements
- **Enhanced**: Template now pushes GPT-4o to use research MUCH more extensively
- **Character Authenticity**: Made Macho Man and Ultimate Warrior MORE in-character
  - **Macho Man**: Added "nothing means nothing!", "too hot to handle, too cold to hold!", gravelly voice, SNORT, mid-sentence intensity changes, excessive metaphors, getting sidetracked
  - **Ultimate Warrior**: Added DESTRUCITY, rocket fuel, crash the plane, no fear no pain, always believe, rapid breathing, veins throbbing, cosmic rage, speaking in bursts
- **Length**: Increased target from ~1000 words to 2000-3000 words total
  - Macho Man: 1500-2000 words (was ~800)
  - Ultimate Warrior: 800-1200 words (was ~400)
- **Detail**: Now requires SPECIFIC facts in every event mention
  - Must quote numbers, awards, achievements
  - Must mention venue capacity, founding dates
  - Must drop artist career highlights, albums, collaborations
  - Instructions: Don't say "this artist is great" - say "this artist who SOLD 5 MILLION ALBUMS and won 3 GRAMMY AWARDS"!
- **Coverage**: Increased from 18-20 events to 20-22 events minimum
- **Depth per event**:
  - High priority (7+): 5-12 sentences with research facts (was 3-8)
  - Mid priority: 3-6 sentences with key insights (was 2-4)
  - Low priority: 1-3 sentences with at least ONE research fact (was 1-2)

### 📝 Files Changed
- `app/adapters/llm/templates/summary.j2` - Extensive character and detail enhancements

---

## [2.0.4] - 2025-11-16 - Bug Fix: Historical Query Type

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Query Type Validation Error: 'historical'
- **Fixed**: Agent was generating `'historical'` query type which wasn't allowed
- **Solution**: Added `'historical'` to the Literal type list (9 total query types now)
- **Files**: `research_models.py`, `query_generation_agent.py`

---

## [2.0.3] - 2025-11-16 - Critical Fix: Research Actually Used Now!

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Deep Research STILL Not Being Used in Promos (v2.0.2 didn't fully work)
- **Fixed**: Research was passed to promo but appended AFTER template, so GPT-4o ignored it!
- **Root Cause**: Template is very prescriptive (123 lines), tells GPT-4o to use event list. Research was added as afterthought at the end.
- **Solution**: 
  - **Inject research INTO each event** in the template (not after!)
  - Each event now shows: `🔬 DEEP RESEARCH (X facts discovered)`, narrative, key insights
  - Added explicit instruction to GPT-4o to USE the research in instruction #10
  - Added banner at top: "DEEP RESEARCH MODE ENABLED!"
- **Impact**: Promos will now be MUCH longer, more detailed, with REAL FACTS!
  - Before: Generic mentions like "ASTN is hitting the stage"
  - After: "ASTN with tracks that hit BILLBOARD charts, collaborations with industry LEGENDS, bringing R&B fusion that critics RAVE about!"

### 📝 Files Changed (v2.0.3)
- `app/adapters/agents/promo_agent.py` - Inject research into event items BEFORE template render
- `app/adapters/llm/templates/summary.j2` - Display research narratives and insights in event list, add instruction #10

---

## [2.0.2] - 2025-11-16 - Partial Fix: Research Integration

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Deep Research Not Being Used in Promos
- **Fixed**: Research results were gathered but never passed to the promo generator!
- **Issue**: 600+ facts collected but promos didn't use them
- **Solution**: 
  - Pass `research_results` from `state.events_researched` to promo generator
  - Enhanced promo agent to inject research insights into prompt (BUT appended after template - didn't work!)
- **Impact**: Partial fix - research was passed but not used (fixed in v2.0.3)

#### Truncated Thoughts in Scratchpad
- **Fixed**: Query text and event titles truncated to 40-50 characters in scratchpad
- **Issue**: `"Researching 'What are Mac Miller's most ico..."` (cut off)
- **Solution**: Removed `[:40]` and `[:50]` truncation from observation logging
- **Impact**: Full transparency in agent reasoning trace

### 📝 Files Changed (v2.0.2)
- `app/adapters/agents/planning_agent.py` - Pass research to promo, remove truncation
- `app/adapters/agents/promo_agent.py` - Accept research_results parameter
- `app/core/ports/agent_port.py` - Updated PromoAgentPort interface

---

## [2.0.1] - 2025-11-16 - Bug Fix: Query Types

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Query Generation Validation Error
- **Fixed**: `ResearchQuery` validation errors for creative query types
- **Issue**: Agent was generating `'cultural_impact'` and `'venue_history'` query types that weren't in the allowed Literal
- **Solution**: Expanded allowed query types from 4 to 8:
  - Added: `cultural_impact`, `venue_history`, `genre_overview`, `collaboration`
  - Kept: `biographical`, `contextual`, `current`, `relational`
- **Files changed**: 
  - `app/core/domain/research_models.py`
  - `app/adapters/agents/research/query_generation_agent.py`
